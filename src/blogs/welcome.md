#### **It's happening folks, my first article is now here!** 

The website is built from the ground up using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and series of its plugins. This is an open-source project which is entirely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ilham-Pratama/tama-blog-site).

This is also my first time writing an article. May take sometime for me to improve my writing, but I'm most definitely looking forward to add more and more content to this website soon ðŸ™‚.

In the meantime you can check on these cute puppies instead.
